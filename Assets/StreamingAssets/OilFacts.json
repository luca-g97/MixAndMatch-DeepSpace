    "The 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill released an estimated 4.9 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico — enough to fill 311 Olympic-sized swimming pools.",
    "Oil can coat the feathers of seabirds, destroying their insulation and buoyancy. Even a thin layer can cause hypothermia or drowning.",
    "After the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989, more than 250,000 seabirds and 2,800 sea otters were killed, along with countless fish and marine invertebrates.",
    "Some oil from the 2010 Gulf spill still lingers on the seafloor more than a decade later, showing how long recovery can take.",
    "Coral reefs are especially vulnerable to oil spills — even small amounts can kill coral larvae, making reef recovery take decades.",
    "Oil doesn’t just float — heavier fractions can sink, smothering life on the ocean floor.",
    "Cleanup operations after major spills can take years and cost billions of dollars, but some ecosystems never fully recover.",
    "In the 1991 Gulf War oil spill, up to 11 million barrels of oil were deliberately released into the Persian Gulf — one of the largest spills in history.",
    "Oil slicks reduce sunlight penetration in water, cutting photosynthesis for plankton and plants — the foundation of the marine food chain.",
    "Some marine animals mistake oil clumps for food, leading to poisoning and internal damage.",
    "Dispersants used to break up oil can sometimes be more toxic to marine life than the oil itself.",
    "Oil spills aren’t just from giant disasters — small leaks from ships and ports happen daily, adding up to millions of liters per year worldwide."
