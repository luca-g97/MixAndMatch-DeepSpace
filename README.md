# MixAndMatch

This project was created in the Interactive Media course Game Spaces at FH Hagenberg. 
The whole game concept is based on the fluid simulation created by Sebastian Lague which is publicly available at https://github.com/SebLague/Fluid-Sim.
It is created to be used together with the Pharus System in Ars Electronica Deep Space.
