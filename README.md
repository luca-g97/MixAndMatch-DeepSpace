# MixAndMatch

This project is based on the fluid simulation by Sebastian Lague which is publicly available at https://github.com/SebLague/Fluid-Sim.

It was adjusted to be used as a game in the context of the Game Spaces course at FH Hagenberg to be used as a game within the Ars Electronica Deep Space.
